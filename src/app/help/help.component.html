      <h2>MATCHING GAME</h2>
      <p>
        In this game, you will see a list of words in English and a list of
        words in Hebrew. Your goal is to draw a line between the English word
        and its corresponding Hebrew word. For example, if the word "Dog"
        appears in the English list and the word "כלב" appears in the Hebrew
        list, you need to connect them. This game helps you learn new words in
        both languages and practice matching words across different languages.
